      - path: "src/EventHandlers/**/*.ts"
        instructions: |

        instructions: |
          Use TSDoc with @param, @returns, and @example.
          Describe external calls, caching/rate-limit behavior, and failure/undefined return paths.
      - path: "src/Aggregators/**/*.ts"
        instructions: |
          Use TSDoc with @param, @returns, and @example.
          Explain diff semantics (incremental fields), snapshot logic, and entity ID conventions.
      - path: "src/**/*.ts"
        instructions: |
          Use TSDoc format with @param, @returns, and @example tags.
          Focus on behavior and edge cases; document BigInt/precision caveats where relevant.
      - path: "**/*.test.ts"
        instructions: |
          Describe test purpose and expected behavior.
          Keep docstrings concise - focus on what is being tested.
